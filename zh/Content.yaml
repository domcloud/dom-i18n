hostFirewall:
  title: Check Firewall
  description: |
    <p>
    Firewall helps your website not to be exploited in the event of a
    hacker break-in by blocking all outgoing traffic except those on the
    <a href="{0}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">whitelist</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Depending on your use of the website, you may want to turn off the
    firewall if your website requires third party API or other forms of
    communication not listed in the whitelist.
    </p>
    <p>The firewall applies to the domain and all subdomains within. It is
    mandatorily turned on for users with free plan. To turn it off, you
    have to be in subscribing plan (Lite or above).</p>

hostNginx:
  title: Check NGINX Config
  description: |
    <p>
    NGINX is our main server gateway that serves HTTP ports (80 and 443).
    To make your website works, your web app must be correctly configured
    here. Here you can view your current configuration and make changes
    either via preconfigured UI or full-blown NGINX config as YAML script.
    </p>
    <p>
    NGINX typically serves static content first that's configured via <code>root</code>
    path, or forward the request dynamically to your App via PHP-FPM <code>fastcgi</code>
    or Passenger <code>passenger</code> if such file doesn't exist.
    </p>
    <p>
    NGINX config is different for subdomains. If your subdomain content happens
    to live inside this website, please enter the subdomain name below to configure it.
    Also, please take a moment to read <a href="{0}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    our NGINX Configuration</a> or contact us in case you came into a problem.

    <p>This page helps you see database lists and create or drop databases that linked to this domain</p>

    We support creating MariaDB (MySQL-compatible), PostgreSQL and Valkey (Redis-compatible) databases.
    To access it, connect to localhost with port 3306, 5432 and 6379 respectively. You can also use our web
    editor to manage its content.
    </p> <p>
    MariaDB and PostgreSQL uses the same username and password across all databases in a domain, while Valkey uses
    the database name as the username and unique password for each database. Also, since our database is shared across
    a single server, administrative queries inside the database is limited. Refer to our documentation for more details.
