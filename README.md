# DOM Cloud Internationalization Repository

This repo contains translation texts for our [portal platform](https://my.domcloud.co), publicized to speed up i18n efforts. We welcome PRs for improvements and even new languages!

DOM Cloud is committed to give the most easily accessible cloud platform for everyone no matter their background and their workflows. 

## Repository Structure

This repo is set as submodule to main portal platform (not open sourced). Changes here reflected to production tipically between a couple hours to a week, as I (the developer) need to push changes manually.

This repo contains JS and PHP files. JS is for frontend. PHP is for backend. The canonical language is english.

If you ask us what our tech stack, it's CodeIgniter and Svelte.
