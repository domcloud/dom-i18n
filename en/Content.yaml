hostFirewall:
  title: Check Firewall
  description: |2
    <p>
    Firewall helps reduce damage on your website in case your
    website got compromised by hackers. It works by blocking all
    outgoing traffic except those listed on the <a href="{0}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">whitelist</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Depending on your use of the website, you may want to turn off the
    firewall if your website requires third party API or other forms of
    communication not listed in the whitelist.
    </p>
    <p>Firewall applies to the domain and all subdomains within. It is
    mandatorily turned on for users with free plan to avoid exploitation.
    To turn it off, you have to be in subscribing plan (Lite or above).</p>
    <p><a href="{1}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read more</a></p>
  offTitle: Firewall is disabled
  offContent: |-
    <p>
    All outgoing traffic is allowed. Keep your site secure, please!

  offBtn: Activate Firewall
  onTitle: Firewall is active
  onContent: |-
    <p>
    All third-party outgoing connection is blocked except listed in the whitelists.<br/>
    Disable the firewall to remove this limitation!

  onBtn: Disable Firewall
hostNginx:
  title: Check NGINX Config
  description: |2
    <p>
    NGINX is our main server gateway that serves HTTP ports (80 and 443).
    To make your website works, your web app must be correctly configured
    here. Here you can view your current configuration and make changes
    either via raw NGINX config (with certain limitation) or interactive generator.
    </p>
    <p>
    NGINX typically serves static content first that's configured via <code>root</code>
    path. If it doesn't exist it will forward the request dynamically to your App via
    <code>fastcgi</code> or <code>passenger</code>. You may add more special routes
    and rewrites depending on your website needs.
    </p>
    <p>
    NGINX is different for domain and subdomains. Please enter the subdomain name below to configure it
    if you wish. Also, please take a moment to read <a href="{0}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    our NGINX Configuration</a> or contact us in case you came into a problem.
    </p>

      When URL path is matched, that will be appended to root path. 
      Checking "root path as alias path" will prevent that.
    cacheExpires: Cache Expiration

     Static files including CSS and JS will be cached in browser for 7 days by default.

    MariaDB and PostgreSQL uses the same username and password across all databases in a domain, while Valkey uses
    the database name as the username and unique password for each database. Also, since our database is shared across
    a single server, administrative queries inside the database is limited. Refer to our documentation for more details.
